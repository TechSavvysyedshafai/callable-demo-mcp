# Results log (honest record; newest last)

Numbers from the Upstox-token session (2026-10-18/19). The planning session has no network access to Upstox, so it
could not independently reproduce these runs. Data: NIFTY 5-minute bars, dev set only (hidden 6-month holdout never read).

| Test | Data | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Futures scalp, momentum signal | real index bars, ~500 sessions, costs at 1 Apr 2026 rates | 1,466 trades, 36% wins, gross ~ -Rs 38k, costs Rs 15.9 lakh, net -Rs 16.3 lakh, break-even 15.3 pts/trade, p vs random 0.25 | FAIL |
| Options scalp, MODEL prices (Black-Scholes), Tuesday-expiry assumption | index bars + India VIX | net +Rs 34k, p 0.025 | PASS (artefact) |
| Options scalp, MODEL prices, real expiry calendar | 300 sessions from Oct 2024 | net +Rs 18k, Sharpe 0.38, p 0.0498 | marginal PASS (model prices) |
| Options scalp, REAL expired-option candles (ATM +/-5 strikes, 2,332 files, 107 expiries) | slippage 0.10 / 0.20 / 0.30 Rs per fill | net -Rs 52k / -62k / -76k, ~687 trades, gross -0.09 pts/trade at 0.10, p vs random 0.09 / 0.075 / 0.12 | **FAIL at every slippage** |

Conclusions
- The model-based option "pass" did not survive real option prices. Modelled premiums flattered the strategy.
- No demonstrated edge in this momentum signal for NIFTY futures or ATM option buying. Do not paper trade or trade it.
- Known gap: 493 signals could not be priced (no saved strike near the money, because only ATM +/-5 strikes around the PRIOR close
  were downloaded). These skew to large-move days. A wider strike download would close this; it is unlikely, but not proven,
  to change the verdict. Candles carry no bid/ask, so slippage is assumed (a limitation that can only matter if an edge existed).
- Trial count so far for this signal: 2. Every new strategy idea tried on this data raises the bar for the next.

## 2026-10-18: Low-turnover daily NIFTY strategies (branch claude/employee-lowturnover)

### Planned (pre-registered BEFORE any strategy number was computed; not to be changed afterwards)

**Question.** Owner wants about 20%/yr, steady. Scalping failed on real data. Can a slow, low-turnover rule on daily NIFTY 50
match buy-and-hold with much smaller drawdowns (or beat it)? The honest benchmark is buy-and-hold (an index fund).
**Mechanism.** Equity drawdowns cluster in high-volatility, below-trend regimes; stepping aside in those regimes may cut drawdowns.
The counter-party who loses is whoever buys into falling trends; we do not assume this works, our prior is "no edge beyond the benchmark".
**Data.** Upstox daily NIFTY 50 bars, 2000-01-03 to today, split with `kite_data.write_split(holdout_months=6)`. DEV data only; the newest 6 months go to the
hidden holdout, which is not read. Bias to state: NIFTY 50 is a PRICE index, it excludes dividends (about 1.2-1.5%/yr), so every
CAGR here (benchmark and strategies, while invested) is understated by roughly that amount; cash leg is assumed 6.5%/yr.
**Trials.** Max 3 strategies + 1 benchmark, no tuning, parameters fixed now.
- B0: buy and hold NIFTY.
- S1: at each close, if close > 200-day simple moving average, hold NIFTY from the NEXT open, else cash at 6.5%/yr. Checked daily.
- S2: at the last trading day of each month, hold NIFTY for the next month if close > 10-month average of month-end closes, else cash at 6.5%/yr.
- S3: exposure = min(1, 12% / forecast annualised vol). Forecast = existing `research/candidate.py` HAR-style forecast of log(high/low), converted to annualised
  volatility; information up to the close, trade the NEXT open; cash earns 6.5%; no leverage.
**Costs (assumptions, not verified facts).** All-in cost per switch (round trip, in % of traded value): 0.10%, 0.25%, 0.50%. Headline = 0.25%.
**Tax.** Verify current Indian equity capital-gains rates from an official source and cite the date; after-tax variant for S1 and S2 (short vs long term).
**Metrics.** CAGR, annualised vol, max drawdown, Sharpe, Calmar (CAGR/maxDD), % time invested, switches per year, worst calendar year. Full dev sample,
first half, second half (by date), and each calendar year. Block-bootstrap 90% CI for (strategy minus benchmark) CAGR and for the max-drawdown ratio.
About 26 years is limited evidence (a handful of independent bull/bear cycles).
**PASS ("useful") at 0.25% cost, in the full sample AND BOTH halves:** (CAGR within 1.5 pp of B0 AND max drawdown at least 30% smaller than B0) OR
(CAGR at least 1 pp above B0 with max drawdown not worse). If none qualifies: verdict is "buy-and-hold index fund is the benchmark and nothing here beats it".
**Controls / stop rule.** Stop at the first of: trial cap reached, criteria met, criteria clearly failed. Any change after seeing numbers is a new trial and will be logged as such.

**Pre-run implementation details, fixed before any strategy number was computed** (these fill gaps in the plan above; they are not tuning):
- Timing: a decision at day t's close trades at day t+1's open. Day t+1 return = w(t-1) x overnight gap + w(t) x (open-to-close) + (1-w(t)) x cash daily rate (6.5%/252-day compounding).
- Cost: each one-way trade of size |change in exposure| pays the all-in cost c on the traded value (c = 0.10 / 0.25 / 0.50%). This is conservative (c is charged on every buy and every sell, so a full in-and-out costs 2c).
- All strategies and B0 are scored over the SAME window, starting when every signal is defined (about late 2000), and B0 pays the entry cost too. "Halves" = the evaluated dates cut at the midpoint.
- S3 conversion: sigma_ann = 252^0.5 x predict()["mean"] / (2 x (2/pi)^0.5) (Parkinson: E[ln(H/L)] = 1.596 x daily sigma). `predict` is called with the last 60 bars (it only reads the last 60), so it is the unmodified `candidate.py`. The daily range excludes the overnight gap, so it understates true volatility; no adjustment is made.
- "Switches per year" = sum of |change in exposure| per year (one full in or out = 1). For S3 this is turnover in full-position units.
- Bootstrap: circular moving-block bootstrap on paired daily returns (strategy, B0), block 63 trading days, 2,000 resamples, seed 0, 90% interval (5th-95th percentile); block 21 shown as sensitivity. Max-drawdown ratio = strategy maxDD / B0 maxDD (below 1 = smaller drawdown).
- After-tax: current rates only (20% short-term under 12 months; 12.5% long-term above Rs 1.25 lakh per year), applied to the whole history as a counterfactual; losses carried forward; Rs 1.25 lakh exemption ignored in the headline (conservative, owner capital unknown); interest on cash leg untaxed (favours the strategies); B0 taxed once as if sold at the end.
- Controls (not extra strategies, not trials): +1 day signal shift, a deliberately leaky signal, and a random on/off placebo matched on % time invested and switch count.
- Trials ledger for this work: `research/lowturn/ledger_lowturn.jsonl` (separate from `research/ledger.jsonl`, so the daily-lab trial count is not disturbed).
